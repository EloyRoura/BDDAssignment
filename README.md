## About:

As a new customer (Not logged in) on eBay, I want to be able to shop for an item I want, to
look for the cheapest item available and use the filtering options available.

## Create a test that would allow the user to:
    * Open eBayâ€™s main page ( www.ebay.co.uk ), login not required
    * Search for an Item (e.g. iPhone)
    * Allow sorting by Best Match / Lowest Price + P&P / Highest Price / Newly listed and the like
    * Filter by All listings / Auction / Buy it now
    * Verify that any given item (e.g. first result) has Free Postage, Number of bids (if the Auction filter is applied, or Buy it now in the case of Buy it now ) and the given price

## Optional
    * Implement the search category filter to allow better searching of items (e.g. searching for Camera with the Books, Comics & Magazines category will return books on cameras, and Cameras & Photography category will return actual cameras)
    * Ability to move to the page X (Where X = 1,2,3,4..) on the results page
